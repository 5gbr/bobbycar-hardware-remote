# bobbycar-hardware-remote
A physical remote for the bobbycar

Features (When it is done):
  - Control the bobbycar with 1 or 2 joysticks.
  - 16x2 LCD for Settings
      - Connect/Disconnect to bobbycar
      - Change WS2812 brightness and (de)activate them (of the remote, maybe bobbycar in the future)
  - WS2812 LED Strip that emulates the current animation of the bobbycar.
  - 4 hardware buttons to control things like blinker.
  - Rotary encoder to navigate the menu on the LCD.

The reason why there are buttons and a rotary encoder is more freedom in designing the software. If you have all the sensors etc. you don't have to worry about the user experience so much as you can just use a different mapping.

ToDo:
  - "Set PWM" screen // Holding for the next days
